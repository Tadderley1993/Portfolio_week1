                        So here is a little about me. My name is Terrence Adderley Jr. and I brough joy into this world on September 12th 1993
                unfortunately at the expense of 10 hours of excruciating labor. Ever since I could hold a video game controller in my hand (in my case a 
                Super Nintendo controller) I have always had a uncontrollable passion for video games and a burning desire to figure out how they work, and eventually how I can make one 
                of my own.

                    <p>
                         My journey to achieving this passion of mine began the Fall of 2010, which was the fall of my senior year of attendance at Brockton High School.
                During my exciting, yet frantic year of researching schools and potential majors I originally decided on completing my first year of college at American International College in Springfield Massachusetts. 
                During this year I had made many friends, learned many lessons, and even was elected class president of my freshman class. But unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances I was unable to complete
                my tenure there and unenrolled my senior year. But that still didn't stop my desire to learn about my field.

                                            Two years later I would enroll in Full Sail University located 
                in Winter Park Florida for an attempt at Completing their 2 year accelerated Game Development Course. But like many things in life this too had its own setbacks and after 4 months the pressures of
                being young and hundreds miles away from home, balancing a job and attending school full time proved too much to handle at the time and threw yet another wrench into my plans. But much like the Boston Red Sox of 2004
                nothing could stop me from striving for my goals, not even this current curse that seemed to be plaguing my desires.

                    <p>
                        From that point of I became self taught in Computer programming and game design. Devoting every
                possible minute to learning more about my craft and immersing myself into the wonderful world of programming languages and development environments. I dabbled in everything from web development, to mobile development, even to full scale 
                video game development. But in order to become even better at this I had to acknowledge that I needed a bit of professional help. So I swallowed my pride, mustered up my courage an became a 2025 Fall Semester admitted student at Bristol Community College
                where I seek the proper leadership and guidance to help me fulfil my dreams and tell this curse of mine to go eat a 504 error! (developers will understand).
