                     The plans is this, work hard to support myself and my family, finish earning my degree here at Bristol Community College Spring of 2027, and from there reach for the allusive goal they call entrepreneurship.

                       That is my current heading on this ship we call life. This semester already has me feeling like the wind is behind me and I have the best crew aboard with me on this journey. Life's never guaranteed. I may in turn never reach my destination. But I strongly feel I put myself on the best path to get there.

                        There are other goals of mine that I would like to achieve as well. For instance, my family is the backbone to my ambition. They raised me with everything they had and I have an undeniable and impenetrable desire to return the favor. So I have to pull my anchor, wave off the bystanders cheering me on from the pier and prepare to brave this brash sea called The Journey.
