                        Nobody tells you that life is not a straight line. There's many twist and turns, and you gain many scrapes and bruises along the way.

                         But its not all bad though. I got my very first job my senior year of high school, where directly after class I had to hustle and catch 3 buses and a train in order to get to my late night shift as a cashier and stocker for Walgreens in Quincy Massachusetts.

                        That job taught me hustle. I would go on to obtain jobs across multiple fields including retail works and even a small stent as a mental health associate. Ultimately in 2019 I attended a 3 week school session with Premier Truck Driving School in Gary Indiana and obtained my Commercial Drivers License and haven't looked back ever since.

                        Currently I have been driving for 6 years and have been to every one of the upper 48 states at least twice before the age of 28. From the mountains of Washington state to the bayous of Louisiana. I've been to Mississippi so many times have a roll-tide keychain currently on my set of keys (I live in Massachusetts). So I've had some journey so far, and still have many miles left to go.
