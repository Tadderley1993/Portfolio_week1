                <p>Each learning style has its own strengths and weaknesses, and individuals may find that they benefit
                    from
                    a combination of these styles. I find that I personally benefit from a mix of writing and
                    kinesthetic
                    learning.
                    I tend to benefit more from doing something on my own and writing it down in order to retain what I
                    just
                    learned.

                <p>Time management is the process of planning and controlling how much time to spend on specific
                    activities.
                    Good time management enables an individual to complete more in a shorter period of time, lowers
                    stress,
                    and leads to career success. Some effective time management techniques include:</p>
