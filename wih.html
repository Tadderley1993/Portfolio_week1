                       The reason why I'm here is simple . . to obtain a degree in game development and hopefully one day achieve my dream of owning and operating my own game studio. The path though.. not so much..

                         Being self taught, the path to video game development has been anything but simple. There's been many hurdles and loopholes that would make the average person cut their losses and throw in the towel. But fortunately my desire to achieve my goals outweighs the obstacles in my way. One of the hardest things to do as an aspiring entrepreneur is to admit your short comings and seek guidance.

                        I enrolled here at Bristol to not only learn the ins and outs of game development, but also conquer some personal barriers that I put up which are hindering me from achieving my dreams. A wise man once told me "A smart person always hires someone smarter than them". Most times people become successful by failing . . tremendously. But by surrounding myself with these learned mistakes I actual gain hands-on knowledge that you cant get from being self taught, you have to get your hands dirty.

                        My hopes for this year is to surround myself with leaders and mentors who are willing to show me what they learned from their mistakes and guide me in the right direction, which is closer to my dreams. In a nut shell THAT is why I'm here.
